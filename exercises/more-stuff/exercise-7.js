What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

*/

/* Answer => 

Exception handling lets the programmer handle an error by alerting the program that an error occurred but then allowing to program to continue execution. 

*/

/* Launch Solution => 

Exception handling is a process that deals with errors in a manageable and predictable manner. It uses the try/catch statement to catch exceptions that the code in the try block raises, and lets the programmer deal with the problem in a way that makes sense and perhaps prevents a catastrophic failure or nasty bug.
